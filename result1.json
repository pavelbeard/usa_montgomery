Campers will be sure to enjoy free swim and playtime in the amazing, brand new aquatic center. Sports such as indoor soccer, basketball, volleyball, handball, and more will be played in a recreational environment in the gym, as will popular camp games like gaga ball, capture the flag, noodle tag, etc.Campers will be given periodic breaks from physical activity to participate in board games and arts & crafts.The swim portion of camp is intended to be recreational and more of a playtime in the pool than competitive swim training, though our coaches will occasionally offer basic swim instruction relating to form and technique. Campers who wish to use the pools will be required to take a swim test on the first day of camp. How they do will determine what, if any, parts of the pools they will be able to swim in. Campers will be divided into groups and there will always be an option for a camper who can't or doesn't want to swim to play sports or traditional camp games. This camp will be directed by an experienced full-time teacher.",

Young people participate in interactive workshops that prepare them for leadership roles and employment. Our goal is to empower participants to effect positive changes within themselves and within their community. Young people will learn about employment opportunities they can pursue and become competent in leading others in activities. Each session concludes with participants coordinating and implementing a capstone project benefiting the local community. In addition to developing useful skills, participants will earn service-learning hours and receive individual evaluations. At Summer Leadership Challenge, young people will learn about establishing lasting friendships, develop a sense of responsibility, learn to work effectively in groups, build accountability, and gain the confidence to solve problems independently. Participants will also receive an opportunity to earn CPR and First Aid certification. You may only register for and participate in one (1) session of SLC. Participants may earn up to 30 SSL hours for the session. No transportation is available. There is no program on July 4th.",

Young people participate in interactive workshops that prepare them for leadership roles and employment. Our goal is to empower participants to effect positive changes within themselves and within their community. Young people will learn about employment opportunities they can pursue and become competent in leading others in activities. Each session concludes with participants coordinating and implementing a capstone project benefiting the local community. In addition to developing useful skills, participants will earn service learning hours and receive individual evaluations. At Summer Leadership Challenge, young people will learn about establishing lasting friendships, develop a sense of responsibility, learn to work effectively in groups, build accountability, and gain the confidence to solve problems independently. Participants will also receive an opportunity to earn CPR and First Aid certification. You may only register for and participate in one (1) session of SLC. Participants may earn up to 35 SSL hours for the session. No transportation is available.",
